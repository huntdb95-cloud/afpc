            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              All Florida Plumbing Contractors was created to give homeowners and
              contractors a plumbing partner they can count on. We started with a small
              service truck and a big commitment: answer the phone, show up on time, and
              stand behind our work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years we’ve grown into a team of licensed plumbers, field
              supervisors, and project managers who understand both service calls and
              large-scale construction schedules. We know how important it is to keep
              projects moving, protect your property, and leave every job cleaner than we
              found it.
            </p>
            <p>
              From emergency leak repairs to complete plumbing systems for new builds,
              AFPC is focused on doing the job right the first time.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Values</h2>
