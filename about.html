            Our Story
          </h3>
          <p>
            All Florida Plumbing Contractors was created to give homeowners and contractors a plumbing partner
            they can count on. We started with a small service truck and a big commitment: answer the phone,
            show up on time, and stand behind our work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years we’ve grown into a team of licensed plumbers, field supervisors, and project managers
            who understand both service calls and large-scale construction schedules. We know how important it is
            to keep projects moving, protect your property, and leave every job cleaner than we found it.
          </p>
          <p>
            From emergency leak repairs to complete plumbing systems for new builds, AFPC is focused on doing
            the job right the first time.
          </p>

              Chris Carucci has built his career in the trades by doing things the right way, even when
              no one is looking. After years of working hands-on in Florida homes and job sites, he founded
              All Florida Plumbing Contractors to offer a company that customers and contractors could trust
              for the long haul.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chris is involved in every part of the business—from reviewing estimates and walking projects
              to checking on workmanship in the field. When you call AFPC, you’re getting a team that reflects
              his values: honest communication, clean work, and respect for your time and property.
            </p>

              Whether it’s a simple repair or a complex commercial build, Chris makes sure the job is handled
              as if it were his own home or investment on the line.
