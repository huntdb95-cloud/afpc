            A Florida-built plumbing company focused on craftsmanship, communication, and
            showing up when it matters.

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              All Florida Plumbing Contractors was created to give homeowners and
              contractors a plumbing partner they can count on. We started with a small
              service truck and a big commitment: answer the phone, show up on time, and
              stand behind our work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years we’ve grown into a team of licensed plumbers, field
              supervisors, and project managers who understand both service calls and
              large-scale construction schedules. We know how important it is to keep
              projects moving, protect your property, and leave every job cleaner than we
              found it.
            </p>
            <p>
              From emergency leak repairs to complete plumbing systems for new builds,
              AFPC is focused on doing the job right the first time.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Values</h2>

                Chris Carucci has built his career in the trades by doing things the right
                way, even when no one is looking. After years of working hands-on in
                Florida homes and job sites, he founded All Florida Plumbing Contractors
                to offer a company that customers and contractors could trust for the long
                haul.
              </p>
              <p style="color:#c2cbc4; font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.7;">
                Chris is involved in every part of the business—from reviewing estimates
                and walking projects to checking on workmanship in the field. When you
                call AFPC, you’re getting a team that reflects his values: honest
                communication, clean work, and respect for your time and property.
              </p>
              <p style="color:#c2cbc4; font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.7;">
                Whether it’s a simple repair or a complex commercial build, Chris makes
                sure the job is handled as if it were his own home or investment on the
                line.
